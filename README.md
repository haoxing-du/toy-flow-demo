## toy flow demo

Haoxing Du, AY250 final project

*Thanks to Peter Schmidt-Nielsen for teaching me React programming!*

This is a web application that is a demo using normalizing flows to solve a toy problem.
The backend is served with Flask, and the frontend is written with React.

To run the app in development mode, run `npm start`. In a different terminal, go into the `backend` directory, and run

`export FLASK_APP=server`

`flask run`
